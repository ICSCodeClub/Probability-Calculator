Please enjoy this program currently in the development stage. This program should be able to determine the probability of
school being cancelled and/or delayed, how much snow you will get, how the condition will be if driving or walking depending
on the time of day, and the chance of getting covid baised off the number of people you hang out with in your group. We will
continue to add features and work to make our data run of statistics as well as work with the observations of real people. So
far this program only works for people in the Lake Washington area but will be later expanded to sorrounding areas.
